# Summary

First post in my - hopefully short - journey trough the wonders of laser eye correction.

I'll start by describing my current vision and what kind of operation I decided
to do, then I'll explain the various methods - as far as I understand them after
months of research - and conclude with the 'why' behind my choice.

# What are we working with

Some numbers that probably mean something to you if you started informing
yourself about any kind of eye surgery:

    Glasses (stable since 2007):
    Right -2.75  -0.50  55°
    Left  -3.75  -0.75 170°

    Corneal thickness:
    around 550 nm

# Refractive Eye Surgery

*Refractive eye surgery* describes medical procedures that aim at improving
(or restoring) as person's vision, ideally achieving optimal vision without
glasses or contact lenses. When talking about laser eye surgery, most of the
procedures are done to correct *[myopia][myopia]* (aka. nearsightedness)


# Getting the cornea in shape

All of the procedures described here have one thing in common: they work
by reshaping the cornea to correct the optical properties of the eye. The
differences center around the question how the laser can reach the cornea.


## Flap vs. Flapless

First of all we need to distinguish between *medical procedures* and their
*brand names*.

The two biggest categories to put procedures in are

1. procedures with *flap*
1. procedures without *flap*

If we only look at *medical procedures* both categories actually only have one
entry, *LASIK* and *PRK* (aka *LASEK*) respectivly. There are more than a dozen
different *brand names* for these two basic procedures.

Some, like *Femto-LASIK*, *All-Laser-LASIK*, *Epi-LASEK*, *Wavefront LASIK*,
*Trans PRK*, *Thin Flap Lasik* actually hint at some aspect of the procedure.
Others like *Premium LASIK*, *eeLASIK*, *Personal LASIK* are just brand names,
used by clinics trying to distinquish their product from others clinics.

Sometimes they are also used to allow some kind of (mostly artifical) market segmentation. 
A few possibly only are offered to have a cheaper alternative so the customer can
feel good about choosing the "better" procedure.


### Flap: Blade vs. Bladeless

In this category, the treatment zone lies at a certain depth within in the cornea. The
exact depth depends on the patients myopia, corneal thickness and the specific procedure.
It can vary widely, but if an average had to be given, it would probably be around 100nm.

The treatmet zone is prepared byt cutting a flap into the cornea, which can be flipped aside
while the laser operates and put back on when the procedure is done, acting as a kind of
natural bandaid.

Advances in laser technology (and FDA approval) opened up the biggest differenation
within LASIK procedures: blade vs. bladeless or rather *microkeratome*
vs. *femto laser* procedures.

The flap can either be cut with a sharp medical instrument (LASIK centers try really
hard to avoid the word *blade*) called microkeratome or with a *femto laser*, usually
different from the laser used for the main procedure.

Very often procedures using the keratome are called *basic*, *classic* or
*standard* LASIK, setting them in contrast to *premium*, *all-laser*, *comfort*
or *no touch* LASIK.

The microkeratome's operation is quite straight forward. The patient's eye lids are
kept open and the eye is fixated with a suction ring. The microkeratome is set
to the spficied height (around 100nm) and the flap is cut.

In principle, the femto laser does the same, but it cuts the flap by creating
hundreds of small air bubbles in a tight pattern at the targeted depth of the
cornea. The flap can then be opened, as if tearing along a perforated edge.


### No Flap: Epithel Removal Variants
