## Summary

First post in my - hopefully short - journey trough the wonders of laser eye correction.

I'll start by describing my current vision and what kind of operation I decided
to do, then I'll explain the various methods - as far as I understand them after
months of research - and conclude with the 'why' behind my choice.

## What are we working with

Some numbers that probably mean something to you if you started informing
yourself about any kind of eye surgery:

    Glasses (stable since 2007):
    Right -2.75  -0.50  55°
    Left  -3.75  -0.75 170°

    Corneal thickness:
    around 550 nm

## Refractive Eye Surgery

*Refractive eye surgery* describes medical procedures that aim at improving
(or restoring) as person's vision, ideally achieving optimal vision without
glasses or contact lenses. When talking about laser eye surgery, most of the
procedures are done to correct *[myopia][myopia]* (aka. nearsightedness)

## Flap vs. Flapless

First of all we need to distinguish between *medical procedures* and their
*brand names*.

The two biggest categories to put procedures in are

1. procedures with *flap*
1. procedures without *flap*

If we only look at *medical procedures* both categories actually only have one
entry, *LASIK* and *PRK* (aka *LASEK*) respectivly. There are more than a dozen
different *brand names* for these two basic procedures.

Some, like *Femto-LASIK*, *All-Laser-LASIK*, *Epi-LASEK*, *Wavefront LASIK*
actually hint at some aspect of the procedure. Others like *Premium
LASIK*, *eeLASIK*, *Personal LASIK* are just brand names, used by clinics trying
to distinquish their product from others clinics. Sometimes they are also used to
allow some kind of (mostly artifical) market segmentation.

Some options possibly only are offered to have a cheaper alternative so the
customer can feel good about choosing the "better" procedure.


### Flap: Blade vs. Bladeless

Advances in laser technology (and FDA approval) opened up the next differenation
within the LASIK "community": blade vs. bladeless or rather *microkeratome*
vs. *femto laser* procedures.

In both cases the flap has to be created, so the refractive laser can work on
the corneal tissue. The difference lies in the creation of that flap.

It can either be cut with a sharp medical instrument (LASIK centers try really
hard to avoid the word *blade*) called keratome or with a laser, usually
different from the laser for the main procedure.

Very often procedures using the keratome are called *basic*, *classic* or
*standard* LASIK, setting them in contrast to *premium*, *all-laser*, *comfort*
or *no touch* LASIK.

The keratome's operation is quite straight forward. The patient's eye lids are
kept open and the eye is fixated with a suction ring. The microkeratome is set
to the spficied height (around 100nm) and the flap is cut.

In principle, the femto laser does the same, but it cuts the flap by creating
hundreds of small air bubbles in a tight pattern at the targeted depth of the
cornea. The flap can then be opened, as if tearing along a perforated edge.


### No Flap: Epithel Removal Variants
